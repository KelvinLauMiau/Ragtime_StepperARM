A 6-Axis Stepper Motor Arm with RK3566 Controller and Comprehensive Robot Kinematics

This repository showcases a low-cost 6-axis robotic arm powered by stepper motors. The armâ€™s design is inspired by the AR4 structure, utilizing MKS servos for Field-Oriented Control (FOC) and the RK3566 as its primary controller. This project includes full forward and inverse kinematics solutions, as well as motion interpolation techniques, providing a robust foundation for robotic motion control. Future updates will include tutorials and demos on dynamic modeling and control for enhanced functionality.
